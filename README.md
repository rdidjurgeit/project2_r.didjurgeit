### Icons

- Icons are taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library and are utilised as classes in the `<i>` tag.
- As they are utilized as classes, they can easily be styled using other classes or IDs in the same tag. I often used Bootstrap classes to style them uniformly.

### Colors

- I wanted the site to maintain a minimal aesthetic, colors are very basic and clean . Using diferent tones of Blue.
- A clean and intuitive interface, allowing you to navigate seamlessly through questions and challenges. The absence of unnecessary elements ensures a distraction-free learning environment.

### Images
