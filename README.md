### Icons

- Icons are taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library and are utilised as classes in the `<i>` tag.
- As they are utilized as classes, they can easily be styled using other classes or IDs in the same tag. I often used Bootstrap classes to style them uniformly.

### Colors

- I wanted the site to maintain a minimal aesthetic, colors are very basic and clean . Using diferent tones of Blue.
- A clean and intuitive interface, allowing you to navigate seamlessly through questions and challenges. The absence of unnecessary elements ensures a distraction-free learning environment.

### Images

- The site has some images for better visualization of the question (to implement).

## Methods

For Validation process you will need to go in each link from W3C and put you code our you page so it can start the process. if there is no mistakes it will have a confirmation image: Common Error you can find is regarding using section and not using header.
